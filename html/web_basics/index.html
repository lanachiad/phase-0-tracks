	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
	<p>Hey guys, Lana here. I have a lot to say and not a lot of time to say it, so <strong>pay attention</strong>!</p>
	<p>My favorite book is <em>Invisible Monsters</em> by Chuck Palahniuk. It's a great book and I've read it multiple times. If you haven't, I highly recommend it!</p>
	<p>Other things I'm interested in include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Video games</li>
		<li>Horror movies</li>
		<li>Bird watching</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I think of all my hobbies, my favorite above all is watching horror movies. I love 'em, but they also terrify me. Here are my top 3 favorite horror movies:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The Witch</li>
		<li>Grave Encounters</li>
		<li>The Conjuring 2</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Anyways, that's all the time I have. <a href="http://google.com">Go back to Google</a> and check out these movies this Saturday night!</p>
