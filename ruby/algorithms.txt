Release 1: Does Dog Need To Go Out?

Check if dog is awake:
	- If dog is sleeping, go back to whatever I was doing.
	- If dog is awake, put down whatever I'm doing.

Check on dog's activity:
	- If dog is playing with his toys, go back to whatever I was doing or play with him.
	- If dog is pacing the apartment, stand up and call dog's name.

Ask dog if he needs to go out:
	- If dog starts nipping at your feet, he's probably just bored and wants to play with you.
	- If dog runs to the apartment door and looks back to you, he needs to go out.
