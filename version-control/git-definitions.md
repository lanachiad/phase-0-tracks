# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. It allows people to view the whole revision history to more than one file in the repository. It also allows you to merge any revisions made by you or others.


* What is a branch and why would you use one?

Branches are a way to create a "copy" of the repo to work on from the master branch so you can make changes and edits to it without affecting the master branch immediately. It's a part of version control.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Commits are considered to be save points when working on a a branch within a repo. It's ideal to make commits often so you can specifically record what changes were made, should you need to revert to a specific commit point. A good commit message is highly specific to what changes were made. For instance: "Added a definition and example of commit."

* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflicts occur when the current branch you're working on and another branch you're merging into have conflicting edits on the same line. For instance, if the master branch says "color: blue" on line 3, and one feature branch you're working on changes that to "color: yellow" and another feature branch your coworker is working on changed that line to "color: green" and pushed those changes while you were still working on a copy of the repo that still had "color: blue," then you'll get a merge conflict.
