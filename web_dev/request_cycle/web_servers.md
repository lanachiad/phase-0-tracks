1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* Small is beautiful
* Each program does one thing well
* Prototype as soon as possible
* Choose portability over efficiency: The portability of shell scripts can be far more efficient in the long run than the perceived efficiency of writing a program in a compiled language—not even considering the time required to compile and test such a program—because they can run on many otherwise incompatible systems.
* Store data in flat text files
* Use software leverage: By using four command line commands, we are leveraging the work of the programmers who created those commands with over 7,000 lines of C code. That is code that we do not have to create. We are leveraging the fforts of those other, under-appreciated programmers to accomplish the task we have set for ourselves. Good programmers write good code and great programmers borrow good code.
* Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability
* Avoid capture user interfaces
* Make every program a filter

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

It's a virtual machine you can use to host data as an extension in running your program and making your program accessible to the public. 

It can be less expensive to host your server on a VPS account rather than on a physical server. They are scalable to meet your demands. It can also come with tech support should you need help with set up and maintenance.

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
